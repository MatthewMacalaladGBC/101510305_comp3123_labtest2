# COMP 3123 - Lab Test 2

***Matthew Macalalad, 101510305***

The following app was created to complete the COMP 3123 lab test on November 27. It involves pulling data from the free OpenWeatherMap API, and displaying it onto the screen. The calls are made via axios, and the data is propagated into various components that comprise the app screen as a whole.

The URL for the chosen API is:
- https://openweathermap.org/

## Here is the output of my created app
